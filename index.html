        <p>I'm Noor Al-Shareedeh (Al-Omari), I'm 23 years old, Iâ€™m from Irbid but I born in Malaysia. <br> I graduated as a civil engineer from Al-Balqa Applied University with very good grade. I have a passion to learn new things and to take new experiences. I am interested in programming and I am developing my skills in this field. I love helping people and I participated in organizing a lot of volunteer work and I had an activity in student work at university. After graduation I worked in private teaching for school students from different stages as part-time work.</p>
